----------
Highlights
----------
 - First work to generate intelligible speech from only lip movements in unconstrained settings.
 - First Multi-speaker Lip to Speech Generation Results
 - Complete training code and pretrained models made available.
 - Inference code to generate results from the pre-trained models.
 - Code to calculate metrics reported in the paper is also made available.


Prerequisites
-------------
- `Python 3.7.4` (code has been tested with this version)
- ffmpeg: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
- Install necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Face detection [pre-trained model](https://www.adrianbulat.com/downloads/python-fan/s3fd-619a316812.pth) should be downloaded to `face_detection/detection/sfd/s3fd.pth`
- Speaker Embeddings pre-trained model at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n1sPXvT34yXFLT47QZA6FIRGrwMeSsZc/view) should be downloaded (navigate to `encoder/saved_models/pretrained.pt`) to `encoder/saved_models/pretrained.pt`.

Getting the weights
----------
Download the [weights of our model](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/radrabha_m_research_iiit_ac_in/EthnCzjwac1NtsVvQv64MK4BB3PxvQE9KMkbrNUAj9rYzA?e=BAR0qh) trained on the LRW dataset.


Preprocessing the LRW dataset
----------
The LRW dataset is organized as follows.

```
data_root (lrw/ in the below examples)
├── word1
|	├── train, val, test (3 splits)
|	|    ├── *.mp4, *.txt
├── word2
|	├── ...
├── ...
```


```bash
python preprocess.py --data_root lrw/ --preprocessed_root lrw_preprocessed/ --split test

# dump speaker embeddings in the same preprocessed folder
python preprocess_speakers.py --preprocessed_root lrw_preprocessed/
```

Additional options like `batch_size` and number of GPUs, `split` to use can also be set. You should get:

```
data_root (lrw_preprocessed/ in the above example)
├── word1
|	├── train, val, test (preprocessed splits)
|	|    ├── word1_00001, word1_00002...
|	|    |    ├── *.jpg, mels.npz, ref.npz 
├── word2
|	├── ...
├── ...
```


Generating for the given test split
----------
```bash
python complete_test_generate.py -d lrw_preprocessed/ -r lrw_test_results/ --checkpoint <path_to_checkpoint>

#A sample checkpoint_path  can be found in hparams.py alongside the "eval_ckpt" param.
```

This will create:
```
lrw_test_results/
├── gts/  (ground-truth audio files)
|	├── *.wav
├── wavs/ (generated audio files)
|	├── *.wav
```

Calculating the metrics
----------
You can calculate the `PESQ`, `ESTOI` and `STOI` scores for the above generated results using `score.py`:
```bash
python score.py -r lrw_test_results/
```

Training
----------
```bash
python train.py <name_of_run> --data_root Dataset/chem/
```
Additional arguments can also be set or passed through `--hparams`, for details: `python train.py -h`
